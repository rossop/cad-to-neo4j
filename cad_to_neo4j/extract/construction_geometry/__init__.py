construction_geometry module

This module provides tools for extracting construction geometries such as planes, axes, and origin points 
from various sources. It includes the following main classes:

- ConstructionPlaneExtractor: A class for extracting construction planes.
- ConstructionAxisExtractor: A class for extracting construction axes.
- OriginConstructionPointExtractor: A class for extracting the origin construction points.

Usage:
    from construction_geometry import ConstructionPlaneExtractor, ConstructionAxisExtractor, OriginConstructionPointExtractor

Classes:
    ConstructionPlaneExtractor
    ConstructionAxisExtractor
    OriginConstructionPointExtractor
