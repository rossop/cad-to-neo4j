Sketch Extractors Module

This submodule contains modules for extracting various properties and information 
from sketch-related CAD objects. It includes extractors for sketches, sketch points, 
sketch curves, sketch dimensions, and profiles. These extractors are part of the extraction 
phase of the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for processing CAD models 
and storing them in a Neo4j graph database.

Modules:
    - sketch_extractor.py: Provides the SketchExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_point_extractor.py: Provides the SketchPointExtractor class for extracting 
      properties specific to sketch point objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_curve_extractor.py: Provides the SketchCurveExtractor class for extracting 
      properties specific to sketch curve objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_line_extractor.py: Provides the SketchLineExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch line objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_circle_extractor.py: Provides the SketchCircleExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch circle objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_arc_extractor.py: Provides the SketchArcExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch arc objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_ellipse_extractor.py: Provides the SketchEllipseExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch ellipse objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_elliptical_arc_extractor.py: Provides the SketchEllipticalArcExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch elliptical arc objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_fitted_spline_extractor.py: Provides the SketchFittedSplineExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch fitted spline objects in CAD models.
    - sketch_fixed_spline_extractor.py: Provides the SketchFixedSplineExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to sketch fixed spline objects in CAD models.
    - profile_extractor.py: Provides the ProfileExtractor class for extracting properties 
      specific to profile objects in CAD models.
    - dimension/: Provides the different SketchDimensionExtractors. Classes for extracting 
      properties specific to sketch dimension objects in CAD models.
    - constraint/: Provides the different SketchConstraintExtractors. Classes for extracting 
      properties specific to sketch constraint objects in CAD models.
